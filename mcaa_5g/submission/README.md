* sim_anneal_many_cities.py: Contains the code the for the proposed algorithm to compute the maximal distance in linear time, which is required when the number of cities is large.
* MH_algorithm.ipynb: Notebook containing the experiments we performed with the HM algorithm parametrized using the tolerance parameter.
* clustering_algo.ipynb: Notebook containing an algorithm that does some approximations (for example aggregating the cities) in order to go faster, good for large instances
* report_team_even_and_odd.pdf: Report of the mini-project.
