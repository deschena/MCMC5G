# Optimal placement of 5G Antennae using MCMC methods

Mini-Project done during the course *Markov chains and algorithmic applications* (COM-516). The goal was to design a randomized algorithm to allocate 5G antennae as well as possible in order to maximize profit. Our starting point was simulated annealing.
